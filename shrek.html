    <h1>Plot</h1>
    <p>Shrek is an anti-social and highly-territorial green ogre who loves the solitude of his swamp. His life is
        interrupted after the dwarfish Lord Farquaad of Duloc exiles a vast number of fairy-tale creatures who
        subsequently relocate to Shrek's swamp. Angered by the intrusion, Shrek decides to visit Farquaad and demand
        they be moved elsewhere. He reluctantly allows the talkative Donkey, who was exiled as well, to tag along and
        guide him to Duloc.

        Meanwhile, Farquaad is presented with the Magic Mirror, which tells him that in order to become a king, he must
        marry a princess. Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is imprisoned in a tower guarded by a dragon. Unwilling
        to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament in which the winner will receive the "privilege" of
        rescuing Fiona. Meanwhile, Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc during the tournament. Disgusted by Shrek, Farquaad
        proclaims whoever kills the ogre as the winner; however, Shrek and Donkey defeat Farquaad's knights with
        relative ease. An amused Farquaad proclaims them champions and demands that they rescue Fiona. Shrek negotiates
        to have the fairy-tale creatures relocated if he succeeds, and Farquaad accepts.

        Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle and are attacked by the Dragon. Shrek locates Fiona, who is appalled by
        his lack of romanticism; they flee the castle after rescuing Donkey. When Shrek removes his helmet revealing he
        is an ogre, Fiona stubbornly refuses to go to Duloc, demanding Farquaad arrive in person to save her. Shrek
        carries her against her will.

        That night, after setting up camp and with Fiona alone in a cave, Shrek confides in Donkey about his frustration
        with being feared and rejected by others over his appearance. Fiona overhears and decides to be kind to Shrek.
        The next day, they encounter Robin Hood and his band of Merry Men. Fiona dispatches them easily with martial
        arts when they harass the group. Shrek becomes impressed with Fiona, and they begin to fall in love.

        When the trio nears Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey later enters alone and
        discovers that Fiona has transformed into an ogress. She explains she has been cursed since childhood, forced to
        transform into an ogress every night, and changing back at sunrise. She tells Donkey that only "true love's
        kiss" will break the spell and change her to "love's true form". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his
        feelings to Fiona, when he overhears Fiona referring to herself as an "ugly beast". Believing that Fiona is
        talking about him, Shrek angrily leaves and returns the next morning with Farquaad. Confused and hurt by Shrek's
        abrupt hostility, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall.

        Shrek abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp, but he realizes that despite his privacy, he feels
        miserable and misses Fiona. Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts Shrek. During their quarrel, Donkey
        explains that the "ugly beast" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and urges him to express his feelings
        for Fiona before she marries. The two reconcile and quickly travel to Duloc by riding Dragon, who Donkey has
        befriended. Shrek interrupts the wedding just before the ceremony completes and tells Fiona that Farquaad is
        only marrying her to become king. The sun sets as Fiona transforms into an ogress in front of everyone, causing
        a surprised Shrek to understand what he overheard.

        Outraged and disgusted, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon, alongside Donkey, bursts in
        and devours Farquaad. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, though this
        permanently makes her an ogress against her expectations; Shrek reassures her that he still finds her beautiful.
        They marry in the swamp with fairy-tale creatures in attendance, then leave for their honeymoon.</p>
